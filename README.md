## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER (READ THIS FIRST)

**THIS TOOL IS FOR LAWFUL, CONSENSUAL USE ONLY.**

- You may only scan text from **accounts/servers/devices you own or have explicit permission** to monitor.
- It **cannot** magically read end-to-end encrypted private DMs on WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. without physical device access.
- Unauthorized surveillance is **illegal** and will get you in serious trouble.
- Always report every detection immediately to **NCMEC CyberTipline**: https://report.cybertip.org/

If you can’t follow these rules, **close this repo right now**.
